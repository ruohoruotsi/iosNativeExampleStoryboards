iosNativeExampleStoryboards
===========================

[OpenFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc) (v0.8) iOS native (UIKit) example project with Storyboards. 

<br>
This project extends the OF built-in example that lives at: ``of_v0.8.0_ios_release/examples/ios/iosNativeExample`` 

To use, you'll need to be comfortable exploiting [OpenFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc) in an Xcode project and generally understand how view controllers and storyboards work.

#### Note:
Since the [initial commit](https://github.com/ruohoruotsi/iosNativeExampleStoryboards/commit/788187eef0b79d1df16ba72131394e3723cee249), this repo has been repurposed (out of convenience really) as a workspace for a variety of [OpenFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc) experiments, including usage of embedded static frameworks, iOS native drawer view controller tests and OF GLSL shader work. Therefore **HEAD** is probably not stable nor builds out of the box on a clean system.

Use the  [initial commit](https://github.com/ruohoruotsi/iosNativeExampleStoryboards/commit/788187eef0b79d1df16ba72131394e3723cee249) as a starting point for your own iOS UIKit + Storyboard + OF work.
